## Sent Meme View
The sent memes view displays recently sent memes. It has a bottom toolbar with tabs that allow the user to toggle between viewing sent memes in a table and viewing them in a grid. The top navigation bar has a title that reads “Sent Memes” and an add button in the right corner displaying Apple’s stock “Add” icon.


If the user taps the “table” tab on the left of the bottom toolbar, sent memes are displayed in a table. If the user taps on the “collection” tab on the right of the bottom toolbar, sent memes are displayed in a grid. Selecting a meme from the table or collection presents the Meme Detail View. Pressing the “add” button brings up the Meme Editor View. 
## Meme Detail View

The Meme Detail View displays the selected meme in an image view in the center of the page with the meme’s original aspect ratio. The detail view has a back arrow in the top left corner. To the right of the arrow reads the title of the previous view, “Sent Memes.”
